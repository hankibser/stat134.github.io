                <li><p><b>Two philosophies</b>: If you are taking lectures notes (or can borrow notes from someone who is), read the lecture notes again before reading the text, that will make the text easier to understand. If you are not taking lecture notes, skim the reading before lecture to maximize the chance that you grok (understand deeply) the lecture. Either way you approach the reading, the examples are your friends. Get to know them, many of them are fun, and they will help you understand the theory.</p></li>
                <li><p>It goes without saying that the Exercises at the end of each section are important. This page lists what you should read before you try those exercises. You can skim at first but if you have trouble with the exercises then read the section carefully before trying the exercises again.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class = "header-xs">Chapter 1</h3>

        <section class="container">
            <ul class=logistics>
                <li><p><b>1.1</b>: Pages 1-5.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>1.2</b>: Pages 11-13.  It is important to understand the figure on page 13.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>1.3</b>: This is the basis of everything that follows. The table on Page 19 should be imprinted on your heart and you should thoroughly understand pages 20-25.  Skip Example 4 for now. Learn to recognize the Bernoulli distribution and the uniform distribution on a finite set.  In this course it is a very good idea to learn to recognize the standard distributions that crop up frequently.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>1.4</b>:  Try following this path: start with Example 2 on page 34.  This motivates the general formula at the top of page 36. Read that formula and Example 4.  Then come back to Example 3 – it's the interesting one.  The multiplication rule on page 37 will come as no surprise.  At this point you should be able to simply read Examples 6 and 7. Compare the general multiplication rule on page 37 with the special case when you have independence, on page 42. Then skim Examples 8 and 9.  See if you can draw a tree diagram that can be used in Example 9.  You should now be able to go back and do Example 4 of 1.3 without reading the solution first.</p></li>          
                <li><p><b>1.5</b>: Page 47 through the discussion that ends at the top of page 51.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>1.6</b>: This obvious extension of the familiar multiplication rule leads to a lot of interesting stuff.  I suggest you start with Example 4.  Then try Examples 2 and 3 (please note the infinite outcome space - everything's nice and convergent so don't worry).  And then the birthday problem in Example 5.  It is useful to note that independence can be slippery when you have more than two events: see Example 8, and also look carefully at the box on page 67 – it is not enough just to check that P(ABC) = P(A)P(B)P(C).</p></li>   
                <li><b>The Chapter Summary is terrific - read it! </b> Pages 72-73. You can ignore the bit on Odds.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <header class="container">
            <h3 class = "header-xs">Chapter 2</h3>
        </header>
        
        <section class="container">
            <ul class=logistics>
                <li><p><b>2.1</b>: Go through pages 79-83 very thoroughly. Then read all the contents of the box on Page 86;
                 follow that by learning the derivation using consecutive odds.&nbsp; Look carefully at the arrays of figures on Pages
                87-89.&nbsp; Go through the captions and make sure you're following the details of what changes as <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> gets large.</p></li>


                <li><p><b>2.2</b>: Everything up to and including the box on Page 101, as well as the discussion of 
                “How good is the normal approximation?” on pages 103-104. &nbsp; I will sometimes use the terms "center" 
                and "spread" for "mean" and "standard deviation" respectively. Also, more formally, "location parameter" 
                and "scale parameter". The normal table is in Appendix 5. </p></li>

                <li><p><b>2.4</b>:  Nice short section, read all of it. </p></li>          
                <li><p><b>2.5</b>: Start on Page 124 at Sampling Without Replacement and read to the end.&nbsp; Again a nice 
    short section, but be careful when you do the problems - counting can be quite slippery.</p></li>
                <li><b>Chapter Summary</b>: Read the portion entitled Binomial Probability Formula on Page 130.&nbsp; Then go over all of Page 131 except the Square Root Law for Independent Trials.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

<header class="container">
            <h3 class = "header-xs">Chapter 3</h3>
        </header>
        
        <section class="container">
            <ul class=logistics>
                <li><p><b>3.1</b>: Skim pages 140-152, through
the box on page 152, then read carefully anything that seems unclear.&nbsp; In lecture we
have done most of this material but without the context of the random
variable. Skip the technical remark starting at the bottom of page 143.
Next read the first paragraph under the heading Several Random Variables (page 153), skim the
definition and consequences of mutual independence of random variables
on page 154. Verify that the messy formula for the multinomial distribution follows
the same logic as for the binomial, and look over the discussion of symmetry
on page 156. </p></li>

                <li><p><b>3.2</b>: This section is the key to 
                much of the rest of the course.&nbsp; You must go through all of it,
except the Gambling Interpretation on pages 165-166 and 
Expectation and Prediction on pages 178-179.&nbsp; The summary box on page 181 is crucial. </p></li>
                <li><p><b>3.3</b>:  This is about the fundamental measure of dispersion,
                 and like 3.2 it must be internalized deeply. Read everything except the Skewness section on page 198.</p></li>          
                
                <li><p><b>3.4</b>:  This formalizes some moves
we've been making for a while, e.g. with the Poisson distribution. But
the examples in this section are all in the context of the geometric
distribution which is the simplest of all the distributions on an
infinite set.&nbsp; Skim the whole section.
</p></li>          
                <li><p><b>3.5</b>: The Poisson is familiar as
an approximation to the binomial.&nbsp; Here it appears in its own
right as a distribution. Read pages 222-224, then 226-227. (We will never cover
the skew-normal approx to the Poisson.) &nbsp; For the
random scatter, read the assumptions in the boxes on page 229 and the
statement of the theorem in the box on page 230.&nbsp; Then read the
Examples 2 and 3, and the note on Thinning. You don't have to read the
proof of the Poisson Scatter Theorem on page 233.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>3.6</b>:  This formalizes the
symmetries that you saw in card shuffling earlier in the
class.&nbsp; Go straight to Examples 1 and 2 on page 240 - you will find
that you could have done them back in Chapter 2 after we talked about sampling
without replacement.&nbsp; The main calculation is
that of the mean and variance of the hypergeometric, pages 241-243. </p></li>          

                <li><b>Chapter Summary</b>:
                You should understand the entire summary deeply. If you don't, spend some time
reviewing anything you feel uncomfortable with before the midterm. Don't
forget the box on page 181.&nbsp; And take a look at the final line, which points you to
Distribution Summaries in the back of the text.&nbsp; These two pages
provide an excellent summary of the important basic ideas of probability. Students refer to them
long after they have completed Stat 134.

        <section class="container">
            <ul class=logistics>
                <li><p><b>4.1</b>: Pages 260-271.&nbsp; Follow the examples closely. Spend some time comparing pages 262-263. Understanding the relationship between between discrete distributions and continuous distributions (defined by a density) is crucial to building a bridge between what you've learned up to now to what we're doing in Ch 4.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>4.2</b>: Pages 278-290, don't care about Gamma Dist for Non-Integer Shape Parameter or anything after that.  Understanding the summary on page 288-289 is important.

Example 4 on page 290 is instructive because it shows how you can use
gamma facts known from the Poisson process context in a setting where
there appears to be no Poisson process.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>4.4</b>: Read the whole section (it's short) and follow the examples carefully. Try hard to wrap your head around the picture on page 305.  Once you get straight what it means, the whole section makes sense.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>4.5</b>: We defined the c.d.f. very

early, when we started 4.1, and used it for the standard normal distributions way before that.&nbsp; So skim pages 311-314, then go over

Examples 1 and 2 and notice that that we did Example 1 in class when we

talked about the uniform density.&nbsp; The discussion of max and min

on pages 316-318 will come as no surprise, given the similarity between the geometric and the exponential distributions.  Pay close attention to the discussion of Simulation starting at the bottom of page 320 and everything to the end, it's not what I would call core material but it's pretty cool.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>4.6</b>: Nice short section, read it all.&nbsp; Remember that identifying a beta distribution is easy &#8211; the density has to look like <span style="font-style: italic;">x</span> to a power times <span style="font-style: italic;">(1-x)</span> to another power, for <span style="font-style: italic;">x</span> between 0 and 1.&nbsp; The rest is just the constant that makes the density integrate to 1.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Chapter Summary</b>: Everything on pages 332-333 except the sections on hazard rates.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Note</b>: Gamma densities are sprinkled throughout the chapter, in particular in

Sections 4.2 and 4.4; the gamma constant also appears in Section 4.6.</p></li>
